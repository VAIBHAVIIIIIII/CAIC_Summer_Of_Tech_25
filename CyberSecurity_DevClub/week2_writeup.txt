Challenge 5) XOR -  A flag encrypted by XORing
Approach:   1. Copy-pasted the encrypted flag in dCode 
		        2. Used dCode - XOR Cipher and XOR-ed using the key as dcCTF as we knew the starting characters of the flag.
		        3. Got sandsa….
		        4. Used sandsa as the key and then tried adding letters to the key to get a meaningful flag.
		        5. The key turned out to be sand.
		        6. Captured the Flag!
Tools/Techniques Used: dCode.fr (Also used a hint)
Solution & Explanation: 1) dcCTF{d0nT_R3peAt_x0R}
                        2) XOR the starting hexes with the hex value of the characters in our required format to get the key.
				                3) Use the key to decrypt the flag
Learnings: Smartly Brute-forcing a key .

Challenge 6) Hidden in Plain Sight- A problem on Steganography
Approach:   1.Used the hint saying Stegseek could solve it easily.
		        2.Used stegseek and rockyou.txt to get the flag deciphered
		        3. Captured the Flag!
Tools/Techniques Used: Stegseek, rockyou.txt (Also used a hint)
Solution & Explanation: 1) dcCTF{h1d1ng_1n_y0ur_w1f1}
                        2) Use stegseek and rockyou.txt to get the flag deciphered
Learnings: Got to know about new tool- Stegseek .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge 7) Chameleon Image- A problem on Steganography
Approach:   1. Looked at the file size, found it suspicious.
		        2. Put it on StegOnline only to find the strings saying - 'The real flag is in flag.txt' 
		        3. Deduced that the image has files hidden in it.
		        4. Used stegseek to get the zip file out of the image.
		        5. Unzipped the zip file to get the flag in flag.txt
		        6. Captured the Flag!
Tools/Techniques Used: Stegseek, StegOnline, (Also used a hint)
Solution & Explanation: 1) dcCTF{POLYGLOT_FILES_ARE_SNEAKY}
                        2) Look for suspicion in the file size, file type.
				                3) If the image seems suspicious, use stegseek to get the contents here, a zip file and extract flag by unzipping and searching for it in the files obtained.
Learnings: Got to know about new tool- Stegseek and File hiding in an image was crazyyy stuff .

Challenge 8) Sound of Secrets - A problem on Steganography
Approach:   1. Put it on dCode.fr - spectrogram to get the spectrogram
		        2. The upper part of Spectrogram had the morse code encoded message.
		        3. Put the morse code in dCode.fr - morse code to get the flag.
		        4. Captured the Flag!
Tools/Techniques Used: dCode.fr - spectrogram and morse code , (Also used a hint)
Solution & Explanation: 1) dcCTF{R34LFL4G}
                        2) Carefully observe the spectrogram and listen to the audio file for hidden messages and unexpected anomalies in the spectrogram.
				                3) Here, morse code was observed which then can be translated using any morse code translator.
Learnings: Observing the spectrogram was fun.

Tools/Techniques Used: foremost
Solution & Explanation: 1) dcCTF{FILE_RECOVERY_SUCCESS}
                        2) Use Foremost or similar tools to recover the corrupted disk image.
				                3) Scan the recovered files for the flag.
Learnings: Recovering the corrupted disk was a good experience.
